# Comprehensive Analysis of Bank Loan Transactions for Enhanced Decision-Making
## Introduction
The banking sector is pivotal in managing personal and business finance through loan offerings. Understanding the dynamics of loan transactions, customer profiles, and repayment behaviors is essential for optimizing lending strategies and minimizing default risks. This project focuses on a bank loan dataset that captures critical information about loan transactions. By analyzing this data, we aim to uncover insights that can enhance the bank's lending policies and improve customer service.
## Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to analyze the bank loan dataset and extract meaningful insights that can assist the business in the following areas:
Loan Status Analysis: Understanding the status of loans (approved, declined, paid, defaulted) and their impact on revenue.
Customer Profiling: Analyzing borrower characteristics, such as income and credit history, to identify trends among high-risk and low-risk borrowers.
Repayment Behavior: Evaluating repayment patterns to enhance collection strategies and minimize defaults.
Loan Purpose Evaluation: Examining the reasons for borrowing and their correlation with repayment success.
## Dataset used:

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
1.Total Loan Applications:calculate the total number of loan applications received during a specified period.

2.Total Funded Amount:the total amount of funds disbursed as loans is crucial

3.Total Amount Received:Tracking the total amount received from borrowers is essential for assessing the bank's cash flow and loan repayment

4.Average Interest Rate: Calculating the average interest rate across all loans

5.Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):Evaluating the average DTI for our borrowers helps us gauge their financial health.
